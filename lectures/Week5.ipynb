    "This week we'll talk about advanced network measures (beyond the degree distribution). We will use these tools to make sense of the Zelda BotW network. \n",
    "This is the outline for today:\n",

    "* Visualization and qualitative analysis of the Zelda BotW Network\n",
    "* Properties of the network structure, including how attributes and other properties shape the network\n",

    "> _Reading_: This week, the reading is mostly for reference. It's for you to have a place to go, if you want more detailed information about the topics that I cover in the video lectures. Thus, I recommend you check out **Chapter 9** of the network science book. In particular, we'll delve into [Section 9.4](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9#modularity) in the exercises below. We will also talk a little bit about degree correlations - you can read about those in [Chapter 7](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/7)\\.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Also, if you want to have a bit of context about the story that takes place in BotW, you can find a short plot to read [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild). Together with the Zelda Wiki, it could help you to interpret some of the structures you'll observe.\n",

    "We will continue to work with the network from last week, see the lecture for [Week 4](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/socialcomplexitylab/socialgraphs2021/blob/main/lectures/Week4.ipynb) for details. This is important! Actually, in order to continue with the lecture, you *need* to complete Week 4. \n",

    "**Important:** To help you with this task and to make sure you have downloaded all characters pages, I have put together the list of characters and their attributes in a [csv file](https://github.com/SocialComplexityLab/socialgraphs2021/blob/main/files/ZeldaBotW_nodes_w_attributes_enriched.csv). Use this file to add nodes with attributes to your network and make sure to find all descriptions and links from the [Zelda Wiki](https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)!\n",
    "\n",
    "*Exercise 1:* Build the right graph for visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Use NetworkX `DiGraph` to store the network of characters. Remember that characters are linked if they have a corresponding link between their Zelda Wiki contents.\n",
    ">   * **Additionally**, extract the largest component - it will make our work with visualizations much easier (note: removing *isolated* nodes (with no links) does not guarantee that you are left with the largest component).\n",
    ">     - *Note 1*: You probably have the right graph if you have more than 500 nodes and more than 1500 edges.\n",
    ">     - *Note 2*: For directed graphs use `weakly connected component` to extract the largest component.\n",
    ">     - *Note 3*: Further analysis is done with the largest component\n",
    ">2. As you build the graph, store the attributes of the nodes (remember the `role`,`race`, and `gender`). On top of that, let's also store the `length of the content` as one of the attributes of the node (i.e. count the number of *words* you have in each character's page). By storing this information as nodal features, we keep all the relevant data in one place. The safe way to count words without counting symbols is to use `regex`, but simpler methods are OK."

If an edge connects allies assign `color_a`, if the edge connects enemies/bosses assign `color_b`, in other cases assign `color_c` (i.e. when allies connect to either enemies or bosses). (Here, you get to decide on the colors.)"

    "*Exercise 1:* Last time we visually analyzed (plotted) the degree distributions of our network. Now, let's analyze it using some of the tools from previous lectures. For this exercise we are going to look at the *directed* graph (rememeber, we asked you to keep one?).\n",

    ">2. Let's also look at the *[exponent of the degree distribution](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/4#degree-exponent)*\n",
    ">    * To calculate it, you can install `powerlaw` package (I could not install in conda, so I used `pip install powerlaw`)\n",

    ">    * When analyzing the plots of in- and out- degree distribution last week, did you come up to the same conclusions?\n",
    ">    * Some long time ago, couple of scientist have analyzed the network that is spanned by the whole Wikipedia (paper is called [Wikipedias: Collaborative web-based encyclopedias as complex networks](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.016115); to access this paper, use findit.dtu.dk or read the preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0602149)). Do your findings correspond to the results described in Chapter **III.A**? If not, why? \n",
    ">3. Plot a scatter plot of the the in- versus out- degree for all characters. Comment on the relation between the two.\n",
    ">4. Plot a heatmap [(Hint here)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369492/generate-a-heatmap-in-matplotlib-using-a-scatter-data-set) of the the in- versus out- degree for all characters. What is the advantage of using a heatmap over the scatter plot?\n",
    ">5. Why do you think I want you guys to use a directed graph? Could have we used an undirected graph instead?\n",
    ">6. We have one more metric that we did not use. The node-attribute `content lenght`. There are two things we can investigate here.\n",
    ">   * Firstly, we can verify that more text means more links. If that's true the length should correlate with out-degree.\n",
    ">   * Secondly, and more interestingly, it could be that longer texts means more famous characters. And that means more in-links. \n",
    ">   * How should you test this? Well, here you are allowed to be **creative**. You may choose the method of your liking to study this question (e.g. look at it visually, test the correlation using spearman or pearson, fit a curve to the data, you decide). Once you've tested, let me know. Are both questions true? If yes, which phenomenon is stronger? Explain your results in your own words."
